Beer_server
===========

I initally thought I might make something where I could log beers into a Raspberry Pi, but am not there yet.

Instead, I collected a bunch of beer ratings and used it as a project to improve my skills with SQL and Python/Pandas. It seems to have worked.

Beer_analysis_v2.ipynb is where the magic happens.
